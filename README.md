# Math Capstone

Papers and presentations for MATH 479 at Western Carolina University.

In this repository are the 3 projects I completed for my senior Capstone course at WCU. Each project is a paper and a presentation. Two were done solo, and one was done as a partnered project.

### Five Color Theorem

**Abstract**:
```
In Mathematics, a graph is defined as a set of vertices and edges wherein the vertices
represent entities in a collection and edges represent connections between them. A planar graph is a
graph that can be depicted on a two-dimensional surface such that no edges overlap. The chromatic
number χ(G) of a graph G is the fewest number of colors needed to color every vertex in a G such that
no two vertices connected by an edge share the same color. The problem of finding χ(G) for generalized
graphs remains unsolved, but work has been done on computing it for graphs with imposed restrictions.
The Five Color Theorem provides a value for χ(G) for all planar graphs G. It is proved using a Euler’s
Formula as a basis and is the strictest coloring bounds for planar graphs provable by traditionally
mathematical techniques.

### Buffon's Needle

**Abstract**:
```
If a number of needles of equal length were dropped onto a ruled surface,
what percentage of the needles would land such that they are crossing a line? The
answer involves the constant π. In fact, this situation is the premise for the Buffon’s
Needle theorem. The probability that a needle will cross a line is related to the length
of the needle, distance between lines, and π. Thus, by reordering this formula, one
can generate an estimation of π by dropping needles onto a ruled surface and counting
the number of needles that cross a line. This experiment illustrates the relationship
between π and probability. A famous recreation of this experiment is widely believed to
be a hoax, which relates this theorem with importance of peer review in Mathematics.

### Game Chromatic Number

**Abstract**:
```
The graph coloring game is a game wherein two players alternate coloring vertices
in a graph G. The minimizer aims to use the fewest number of colors possible,
and the maximizer aims to prevent the graph from being properly colorable. The
game chromatic number χg (G) of a graph is the fewest number of colors needed
to guarantee that the minimizer can win. There exists no known algorithm to
determine χg (G) for an arbitrary graph, but when certain restrictions are placed
on G, bounds can be proven. In this paper, we will prove why the game chromatic
number of a a forest F is at most 4. We will also show the criteria needed for
χg (F ) = 2, and discuss minimal order trees with χg (F ) = 4.
